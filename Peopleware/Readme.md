# Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams

If you could effect some change in the people you manage and make them much more productive and goal-directed but also less controllable, would you do it? The answer to this question distinguishes the great managers from the merely mediocre. The mediocre manager is too insecure to give up the trappings. The great manager knows that people can’t be controlled in any meaningful sense anyway. **The essence of successful management is to get everyone pulling in the same direction and then somehow get them fired up to the point that nothing, not even their manager, could stop their progress.**

To allow the Hawthorne Effect to work for you, you have to make nonstandard approaches the rule. Whatever standard there is should be brief and gentle. The total of all standards imposed upon your people should be described in no more than ten pages. (This is no pipe dream; many organizations that have given up on the Methodology-as-Law approach end up with ten-page standards manuals.) You ought to be prepared to grant exceptions to even this loose guide. This gives you a development environment consistent with the views of that famous business sage Mao Tse-tung:

*Let a hundred flowers blossom and*
*let a hundred schools of thought contend.*

Of course, Mao didn’t really mean it, but we do.

First of all, it’s worth saying that project risk is a good thing, a likely indicator of value. Projects that have real value but little or no risk were all done ages ago. The ones that matter today are laden with risk.
